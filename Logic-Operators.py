#Booleans can not be all lower case, They must start with an uppercase letter (T, F). Also, you cannot use quotes 
#Booleans are created by doing a compare operation

2 == 3 # 2 is equal to 3

3 < 2 # 3 is less than 2 

2 != 3  # 2 is not equal to 3

4 >= 2 # 4 is geater than or equal to 2

3 <=2 # 3 is less than or equal to 2
