#Tuples are similar to lists but they can not be changed (immutable), they are made of elements like lists so all element operations are valid, 

my_tuple = (1,2,3,"a","b","c")

my_list = [1,2,3,4,5,6,7]

my_list[2] = 100

#you cant do that with a tuple

#When you want to use a tuple is if you want data to be protected but refer to it later. You dont want it to be modified

#Use the tuple() function to convert other things to a tuple
